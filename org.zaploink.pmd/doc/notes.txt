TODO:
- write readme
	- usage example (a project with pmd config + zaploink config)
	- explain rule config format
	- explain setup (add zaploink rules to classpath, set system property, select rule set)
		- explain adding of system property to PMD
		- explain adding zaploink-custom rules to gradle pmd classpath + gradle pmd config
		- currently there is only one zaploink rule, so the whole set can be added
		- also needs gson on classpath!
		
- create exampes
	- simple: automatic domain recognition
	- simple with exceptions (additional internal packages, make some internal classes public)
	- completely custom (put domain together)
